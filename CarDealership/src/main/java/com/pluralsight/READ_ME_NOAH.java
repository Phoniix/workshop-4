    // 5/10/25 Just made a class to make comments and whatnot. I'll lyk what I stop working on (IE class name and line number
    // or just any notable changes or questions I have on your stuff if I think of it. My goal is to finish the
    // File input / output system on the com.pluralsight.DealershipFileManager class by end of 5/10. I want the files to be set up
    // pretty and neat. Will write more notes here in the future.

    // 5/10/25 Have to set up getters in com.pluralsight.Vehicle class.  Will also setup some of user interface.
